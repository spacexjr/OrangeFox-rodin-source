## Supported devices

- POCO X7 Pro
- Redmi Turbo 4

Both devices use the rodin A/B `vendor_boot` recovery layout.

There is no standalone recovery partition.

## Release profiles

The release build produces two recovery profiles:

| Profile | Intended ROM environment | Firmware model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HOS / OEM-Port | HyperOS and compatible OEM-port ROMs | Region-agnostic unified PLATFORM |
| AOSP | Supported AOSP-based ROMs | Separate AOSP profile |

Each profile is available as:

- AVB Enabled
- AVB Disabled

This results in four release images total.

## Unified HOS / OEM-Port compatibility

There is one HOS/OEM-port `vendor_boot`.

There are no market-region-specific HOS release images.

The unified HOS PLATFORM contains two complete module trees.

| Firmware family | Verified kernel release |
| --- | --- |
| 6.6.77 stock baseline | `6.6.77-android15-8-gca30f3b4bef6-abogki440974771-4k` |
| 6.6.89 stock baseline | `6.6.89-android15-8-g8e4be6b47e40-ab14134548-4k` |

These module payloads are proven stock baselines, not an exact running-kernel whitelist.

No market-region build variable is required. Runtime compatibility follows the Android15-6.6 GKI/KMI contract and compatible vendor environment rather than an exact 6.6.x patchlevel.

## 6.6.77 stock module baseline

The unified PLATFORM retains the proven Rodin 6.6.77 stock module baseline.

The unified PLATFORM carries the complete matching 6.6.77 stock module set independently from the 6.6.89 module set.

The unified HOS image was originally validated against the Rodin 6.6.77 stock baseline.

Verified behavior includes:

- recovery boot
- correct stock module loading
- OrangeFox device module loading
- touch
- haptics
- userdata block mapping
- Fastbootd

## 6.6.89 stock module baseline

The unified PLATFORM retains the proven Rodin 6.6.89 stock module baseline.

The unified HOS image was originally validated against the Rodin 6.6.89 stock baseline.

Verified behavior includes:

- recovery boot
- correct 6.6.89 stock module loading
- OrangeFox device module loading
- touch
- haptics
- userdata block mapping
- Fastbootd

## Historical Global / India equivalence

India and Global/MIXM stock PLATFORM ramdisks were directly compared.

Their complete 244-module payloads are identical and use the same 6.6.89 module ABI.

That comparison proved those stock regional packages share the same 6.6.89 module payload. It is retained as a stock baseline; compatibility is governed by GKI/KMI and the vendor environment rather than region or exact patchlevel.

## Additional GKI runtime validation

The same HOS/OEM-port OrangeFox image has also been runtime-validated with newer compatible Android15-6.6 GKI kernels:

- stock EEA `6.6.118-android15-8-ge56cf6b09cca-ab15511674-4k` — recovery booted with 551 loaded modules
- custom `6.6.142-EVONIX-COS-V3.5` — recovery booted with 247 loaded modules, including Rodin touch, haptics and SCP modules

This confirms that the stored 6.6.77 and 6.6.89 module payloads are compatibility baselines rather than an exact 6.6.x kernel-version whitelist.

## AOSP compatibility

AOSP remains a separate build profile.

It uses:

- `prebuilt/aosp/vendor_ramdisk00`
- `prebuilt/aosp/bootconfig`

The AOSP profile does not use the unified HOS PLATFORM.

The AOSP image should be used only for supported AOSP-based ROM environments.

Do not flash the HOS/OEM-port profile merely because the device itself is rodin; the installed ROM environment matters.

## AVB Enabled

Use the AVB Enabled image when the installed ROM uses its normal signed AVB configuration.

This is the default HOS release output.

## AVB Disabled

Use the AVB Disabled image when the ROM or installation explicitly requires first-stage AVB flags to remain disabled.

The disabled HOS image is generated from the same unified PLATFORM with only first-stage `avb` and `avb_keys` fstab flags removed.

If an AVB Enabled image causes a bootloop on a ROM that requires AVB disabled, use the matching AVB Disabled profile instead.

## Verified recovery functionality

The current source has been validated for:

- OrangeFox boot
- touch input
- haptics
- MTP
- ADB
- FBE user-data decryption
- Fastbootd
- A/B slot switching
- ROM-install recovery preservation
- Format Data workflow
- USB OTG preservation
- legacy ARM32 Edify installer fallback through the ARM64 updater path

## Fastbootd

Fastbootd has been runtime-tested under both verified HOS kernel families.

Expected userspace Fastboot output includes:

```text
is-userspace: yes
product: rodin
```

The Fastbootd implementation includes the rodin non-blocking BootControl and optional-HAL lookup fixes.

## Flashing

Only flash the final 64 MiB `vendor_boot` image produced by the rodin build flow.

Valid partitions are:

```text
vendor_boot_a
vendor_boot_b
```

Do not use `vendor_boot_ab`.

For testing, flash only the intended slot unless modifying both slots is explicitly required.

## Recovery image selection

For OEM/HOS environments choose one of:

```text
OrangeFox-R12.0-NEESCHAL-rodin-HOS-AVB-ENABLED.img
OrangeFox-R12.0-NEESCHAL-rodin-HOS-AVB-DISABLED.img
```

For supported AOSP environments choose one of:

```text
OrangeFox-R12.0-NEESCHAL-rodin-AOSP-AVB-ENABLED.img
OrangeFox-R12.0-NEESCHAL-rodin-AOSP-AVB-DISABLED.img
```

There are no market-region-specific HOS release images.

## Support boundary

Compatibility claims are based on the verified Rodin Android15-6.6 GKI/KMI and vendor environments described above. Market-region labels and exact 6.6.x patchlevels do not select the recovery image.

A different Android/LTS GKI family, incompatible KMI/vendor ABI, unrelated vendor environment, or substantially modified vendor_boot layout remains outside the verified compatibility baseline until tested.

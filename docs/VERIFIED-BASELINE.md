## Device tree

Canonical device source:

`device/xiaomi/rodin`

The public release workflow uses:

```bash
./build-release.sh
```

The release build produces four images:

- unified HOS AVB Enabled
- unified HOS AVB Disabled
- AOSP AVB Enabled
- AOSP AVB Disabled

## Patched external repositories

Verified development revisions:

| External repository | Verified development revision |
| --- | --- |
| `bootable/recovery` | `15587c4fe7fbfff2825ec7ba8754066949060e15` |
| `hardware/interfaces` | `61f0bcd25bdbf2b6d4d978fdfa348bf01078a8f8` |
| `system/core` | `f16d1d3fdd463571601dd01d526643cd0230aa43` |

The remaining untouched source projects are verified against the pinned OrangeFox source manifest.

## Fastbootd patches

BootControl non-blocking lookup patch SHA-256:

`e10f789766f359d5d4b91d2fa7ee8418d5c39694f7c914d5cc02c6aa533755b8`

Fastbootd optional-HAL non-blocking patch SHA-256:

`740b10ad8cae477e8d387406b61594db869f83ab3fe0a15af46ec4ca6fc655e6`

Runtime Fastbootd verification produced:

```text
is-userspace: yes
product: rodin
```

on both verified HOS kernel families.

## Unified HOS PLATFORM

Pinned file:

`prebuilt/unified/vendor_ramdisk00`

SHA-256:

`dda9762619ee1cbe3019735103ddd25c62ebd9d2431e991303d5855520d93389`

Compression:

`Zstandard`

The PLATFORM contains independent module trees for:

| Firmware family | Verified kernel release |
| --- | --- |
| 6.6.77 stock baseline | `6.6.77-android15-8-gca30f3b4bef6-abogki440974771-4k` |
| 6.6.89 stock baseline | `6.6.89-android15-8-g8e4be6b47e40-ab14134548-4k` |

Both stored stock-baseline payloads retain the complete stock module content required by their respective baseline environments before the OrangeFox device modules are added.

## Historical Global and India module equivalence

The stock Global/MIXM and India PLATFORM ramdisks were directly compared.

Both contain 485 files and 244 stock kernel modules.

Their file layouts are identical.

Their complete kernel-module payloads are identical and use:

`6.6.89-android15-8-g03fb7c87b0b5-4k`

The observed content differences were limited to:

- `prop.default`
- `system/etc/copylib.txt`

This historical comparison established a common 6.6.89 module payload for those stock packages. Runtime selection is kernel-based rather than region-based.

## Unified HOS runtime validation

The unified HOS vendor_boot architecture has now been tested across multiple compatible Android15-6.6 GKI patchlevels, including stock and custom kernels.

6.6.77 test kernel:

`6.6.77-android15-8-gca30f3b4bef6-abogki440974771-4k`

6.6.89 test kernel:

`6.6.89-android15-8-g8e4be6b47e40-ab14134548-4k`

Verified on both:

- OrangeFox boot
- correct stock module-tree selection
- OrangeFox touch modules
- haptics module
- userdata block mapping
- recovery storage access
- Fastbootd
- userspace Fastboot identification

The OrangeFox device-specific module set successfully loaded under the original 6.6.77 and 6.6.89 validation environments.

Additional runtime validation also confirmed:

- stock EEA 6.6.118 booted OrangeFox with 551 loaded modules
- custom 6.6.142-EVONIX-COS-V3.5 booted OrangeFox with 247 loaded modules, including Rodin touch, haptics and SCP modules

These results demonstrate that the stored 6.6.77 and 6.6.89 payloads are stock module baselines rather than an exact 6.6.x kernel-version whitelist.

## Unified prototype

The first dual-kernel AVB-disabled unified prototype SHA-256 was:

`57df845928e5716ae486f9d1be4e2e577006040fe432b274ba4b16384dfab2ad`

It was runtime-tested under both supported Rodin kernel families: 6.6.77 and 6.6.89.

## Verified release build

A complete `./build-release.sh` run completed successfully and produced all four release images.

| Release image | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| HOS AVB Enabled | `2d17e011cdbb1d9f7c21d4a7f4a0688c8823df65e10070db60837bccd9880fed` |
| HOS AVB Disabled | `3d276e4df21dfaba31215ef1e6a283b2693e1faa6d3ca235e9de2740a80ba60f` |
| AOSP AVB Enabled | `47d29039fcac073fdceb5bcc86df0db1abdb6d81bb2a300b868003e429638346` |
| AOSP AVB Disabled | `23607d444d45b1db279117c70944255f5cece027d9ed2b21c41ad1c5dee6bffd` |

The default `vendor_boot.img` output points to the unified HOS AVB Enabled image.

## Verified HOS packaging

The successful unified HOS AVB Disabled build reported:

| Component | Size (bytes) | Compression |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| PLATFORM | 22564936 | Zstandard |
| RECOVERY | 38600750 | LZ4 |
| Combined vendor ramdisk | 61165686 | Zstandard PLATFORM + LZ4 RECOVERY |

This remains below the rodin build safety limit of 62000000 bytes.

## Recovery behavior baseline

The current recovery baseline includes verified support for:

- touch
- haptics
- MTP
- ADB
- FBE decryption
- Fastbootd
- A/B slot switching
- ROM-install recovery preservation
- Format Data
- USB OTG preservation
- legacy ARM32 Edify installer fallback
- file-backed ADB sideload package handling
- Virtual A/B recovery snapshot/COW creation
- loop-backed COW mapping when userdata is directly mounted
- full recovery OTA installation through update_engine

## Support boundary

The verified HOS compatibility baseline covers compatible Rodin Android15-6.6 GKI/KMI and vendor environments. Runtime proof currently includes stock 6.6.77, stock 6.6.89, stock EEA 6.6.118, and custom 6.6.142-EVONIX-COS-V3.5. Firmware market-region labels and exact 6.6.x patchlevels do not select the recovery image.

AOSP remains a separate profile with its dedicated PLATFORM and bootconfig.

A different Android/LTS GKI family, incompatible KMI/vendor ABI, or unrelated vendor environment requires separate validation before being declared supported.

## Auto-DFE v2 validation

Historical recovery revision used for the Auto-DFE v2 validation:

`eaa1bf3d2c71b4c8c2ecccdb24f1170b0fe4d8e7`

Auto-DFE v2 adds compression-aware vendor_boot v4 PLATFORM handling.

Verified behavior:

- legacy LZ4 PLATFORM support retained
- Zstd PLATFORM support added through libzstd
- PLATFORM size and offset are taken from the vendor ramdisk table
- Zstd does not depend on an LZ4 end-marker scan
- rebuilt PLATFORM must remain within the original allocation
- actual rebuilt PLATFORM size is written back to the v4 ramdisk table
- other vendor_boot fragments remain at their existing offsets
- AVB hash refresh and rollback protections remain active

The unified HOS Zstd dry-run completed successfully:

`Auto-DFE DRY-RUN PASS. Nothing was flashed.`

The target vendor_boot remained unchanged during dry-run.

Final normal recovery startup was also verified with successful FBE decryption and the required rodin modules loaded.
